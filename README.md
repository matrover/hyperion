# Hyperion on balena

[Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) is an opensource Bias or Ambient Lighting implementation which you might know from TV manufacturers. It supports many LED devices and video grabbers.

This Dockerfile has been repurposed from [**psychowood/hyperion.ng-docker**](https://github.com/psychowood/hyperion.ng-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile) to work for balena devices.
